    <h2 class="a">About Jessica</h2>
    <p>Jessica Imperiale is a college student studying at Georgian Court University. Her major is Graphic
     Design and Multimedia and she is also minoring in Studio Art. Her work can be seen in the gallery 
     below.</p>
    <h2 class="a">Interview</h2>
    <h2 class="b">Why are you taking this class?</h2>
    <p>It's a major requirement but I also wanted to learn to make a portfolio website for my work.</p>
    <h2 class="b">What is your birthday?</h2>
    <p>June 12th, 2001.</p>
    <h2 class="b">What superpower would you want to have?</h2>
    <p>Invisibility.</p>
    <h2 class="b">Do you have any siblings?</h2>
    <p>I have one brother.</p>
    <h2 class="b">What is your favorite Pokemon?</h2>
    <p>Leafeon or Sylveon. Iâ€™m a grass and fairy type trainer and I love Eevee so those two are my tops.</p>
    <h2 class="b">Do you believe in ghosts?</h2>
    <p>In a way, I believe in visitors but none that can harm you. We have a belief in my family that if 
        there is a penny on the ground it means someone in heaven has visited you.</p>
    <h2 class="b">What are your sleeping habits?</h2>
    <p>Usually 12am through 8am.</p>
    <h2 class="b">Do you ever feel like you are being watched?</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, not all the time.</p>
    <h2 class="b">Pineapple on pizza?</h2>
    <p>Sounds gross, but I've never had it so I can't really say.</p>
